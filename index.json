Additionally, she works on symmetry, structure, and equivariance in single and multi-agent reinforcement learning and machine learning.\nBefore joining MSR, she did a Ph.D. in the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab, working with Max Welling (UvA), Frans Oliehoek (TU Delft), and Herke van Hoof (UvA). During her Ph.D., she spent time in DeepMind’s multi-agent team. Elise was an invited speaker at the BeneRL 2022 workshop and the Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning workshop at ICLR 2021. She was also a co-organizer of the workshop on Ecological/Data-Centric Reinforcement Learning at NeurIPS 2021.\n","date":1675335600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675335600,"objectID":"186badacc56550aa55d46fc5c9589fb9","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/symmetry-and-structure-in-single-and-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/symmetry-and-structure-in-single-and-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/","section":"event","summary":"**Speaker** : Elise van der Pol - [Zoom link](https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/84772988115?pwd=a2tSdTJDQi8wTDhsOVM5WlJZYWc2UT09)","tags":[],"title":"Symmetry and Structure in Single and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"ee954fa6dd1a12b25dcf654651f7c547","permalink":"https://example.com/organizers/arnab/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/arnab/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Arnab Mondal","type":"organizers"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"4aab91615323bced231894af5bf96e8d","permalink":"https://example.com/organizers/oumar/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/oumar/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Sékou-Oumar Kaba","type":"organizers"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2d8590da3020882a4ee0341eb341af5c","permalink":"https://example.com/organizers/tara/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/tara/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Tara Akhnoud-Sadegh","type":"organizers"}]
