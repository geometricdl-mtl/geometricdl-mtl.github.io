His work is at the intersection of representation learning, differential geometry and Bayesian optimization, applying these to procedural content generation. During his Ph.D., Miguel did an internship at the Bosch Center for AI, working with Leonel Rozo on applications of Gaussian Processes on manifold-valued data to robotics.\n","date":1677150000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677150000,"objectID":"0fe6478b02c375abdf53cbfaaa7766a4","permalink":"https://geometricdl-mtl.github.io/talk/pulling-back-information-geometry/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pulling-back-information-geometry/","section":"event","summary":"**Speaker** : Miguel González Duque","tags":[],"title":"Pulling back information geometry","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Speaker: Elise van der Pol (Website)\nAbout the speaker: Elise van der Pol is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research AI4Science Amsterdam, working on reinforcement learning and deep learning for molecular simulation. Additionally, she works on symmetry, structure, and equivariance in single and multi-agent reinforcement learning and machine learning.\nBefore joining MSR, she did a Ph.D. in the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab, working with Max Welling (UvA), Frans Oliehoek (TU Delft), and Herke van Hoof (UvA). During her Ph.D., she spent time in DeepMind’s multi-agent team. Elise was an invited speaker at the BeneRL 2022 workshop and the Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning workshop at ICLR 2021. She was also a co-organizer of the workshop on Ecological/Data-Centric Reinforcement Learning at NeurIPS 2021.\n","date":1675335600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675335600,"objectID":"186badacc56550aa55d46fc5c9589fb9","permalink":"https://geometricdl-mtl.github.io/talk/symmetry-and-structure-in-single-and-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/symmetry-and-structure-in-single-and-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/","section":"event","summary":"**Speaker** : Elise van der Pol - [Zoom link](https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/84772988115?pwd=a2tSdTJDQi8wTDhsOVM5WlJZYWc2UT09)","tags":[],"title":"Symmetry and Structure in Single and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"ee954fa6dd1a12b25dcf654651f7c547","permalink":"https://geometricdl-mtl.github.io/organizers/arnab/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/arnab/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Arnab Mondal","type":"organizers"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"4aab91615323bced231894af5bf96e8d","permalink":"https://geometricdl-mtl.github.io/organizers/oumar/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/oumar/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Sékou-Oumar Kaba","type":"organizers"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2d8590da3020882a4ee0341eb341af5c","permalink":"https://geometricdl-mtl.github.io/organizers/tara/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organizers/tara/","section":"organizers","summary":"PhD Student at Mila and McGill University","tags":null,"title":"Tara Akhound-Sadegh","type":"organizers"}]
